ONE NET 4 ALL — AI-Powered Network Blackout Zone Remedial Solution

-->Overview
ONE NET 4 ALL is an AI-driven project designed to eliminate mobile network blackout zones—especially in tunnels, underground stations, and remote regions—by integrating smart connectivity management and hybrid network technologies.

-->Core Idea
The system leverages ASTGCN (Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks) to detect, map, and predict signal degradation in real time. Using dynamic heatmaps, it enables targeted infrastructure deployment through a cost-efficient “Patchy Network” concept, ensuring strategic and optimized resource allocation.

-->Key Features

AI-powered blackout zone detection using real-time data and pattern learning.

Hybrid network infrastructure combining Leaky Coaxial Cables (LCC), Micro-Cells, and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS).

Legal and ethical compliance aligned with constitutional rights (Articles 19, 21, 21A) and data protection laws (DPDP Act 2023).

Cost optimization through data-driven deployment and reduced CAPEX/OPEX.

Enhanced user experience with uninterrupted internet, stable calls, and secure transactions.

-->Impact & Benefits

Ensures seamless connectivity and digital inclusion as a fundamental right.

Enables safe communication, real-time digital services, and emergency responsiveness in critical areas.

Supports sustainable infrastructure planning with AI-assisted predictive maintenance.

-->Goal

Transform digital access from a privilege into a universal right, bridging connectivity gaps across India’s transit systems and beyond.
